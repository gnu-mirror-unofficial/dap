to Dap</a></h4>
Dap is a small statistics and graphics package based on C.&nbsp; It provides
core methods of data management, analysis, and graphics that are commonly
used in statistical consulting practice (univariate statistics, correlations
and regression, ANOVA, categorical data analysis, logistic regression,
and nonparametric analyses).&nbsp; Anyone familiar with the basic syntax
of C programs can learn to use Dap quickly and easily from the manual and
the examples contained in it; advanced features of C are not necessary,
although they are available.&nbsp; (The manual contains a brief introduction
to the C syntax needed for Dap.)&nbsp; Because Dap processes files one
line at a time, rather than reading entire files into memory, it can be,
and has been, used on data sets that have very many lines and/or very many
variables.
<p>I wrote Dap to use in my statistical consulting practice because the
utterly famous, industry standard statistics system (you know the one I
mean) is not available on GNU/Linux and costs a bundle every year under
a lease arrangement. I was generally happy with that system, except for
the graphics, which are all but impossible to use,&nbsp; but there were
a number of clumsy constructs left over from its ancient origins. Thus,
I decided to mimic the core of the functionality of that system in the
context of the C language, which allows much more programming flexibility.
<p>Dap is a GNU program and is free software distributed under a GNU-style
copyleft.
